Connect 4 Machine Learning Project

This is a personal meant to create a basic algorithm to play Connect 4 using machine learning. I used Flask and Jinija to create a localy hosted website as a display, and then attempted to create different algorithms capable of playing connect four. These algorithms are not meant to be efficent or compitent at Connect 4 but were simply meant as a test of what I could do and was a fun side project. While I do not plan to expand this I may try and create a more compitent algorithm in the future.

If you wish to view the webpage, run server.py and then connect to localhost:5000 in a browser.
